1. (Answer supplied by team consisting of deHaan, LaCroix and Coria)
The goal of a CI here is to find the range of the mean heart rates that is likely to contain the population parameter.

```{r,fig.width=5,fig.height=3}
x = do(5000) * (mean(~HeartRate, data=resample(ICUAdmissions)))
histogram(~result, data=x)
```

```{r}
mean(~HeartRate, data=ICUAdmissions)
qt(.975,199)
sd(~HeartRate, data=ICUAdmissions)
```

```{r}
98.925 + c(-1,1)*1.97*26.83/sqrt(200)
```
